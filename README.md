# Game Deals

## Purpose
This program is designed to search and save games, and provide information on prices and current deals from a variety of reputable online stores.
This serves to remove the need for managing multiple apps and/or store services to keep track of your favourite games, and have a central location to reliably get aggrigate and live information on these games.

## What Can You Do?
There are two main functions of this app; Searching and Saving, with some other smaller features available like; getting the latest deals.
- Getting Deals allows you to find all of the latest deals from a variety of reputable online stores.
- Searching allows you to search for any game, edition, DLC, or bundle that is available on said stores.
- Saving allows you to save any game you search for in a tracked deals list, allowing you to quickly see the current sale and price status of these games.

## Requirements
The only requirement in using the app is an active internet connection, as the app uses an API service to get game information.

## Behind the Scenes
Full credit for the information used in this app goes to the CheapShark team and their API service.
